## 🧠 Overview

**MobileNet** is a family of efficient convolutional neural networks designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. This app integrates several MobileNet versions to allow:

- 📷 **On-device image classification** (no internet needed)
- ⚖️ **Comparison of accuracy vs. speed** across MobileNet variants
- 📱 **Real-time deep learning** optimized for mobile hardware

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, this app helps explore lightweight deep learning models in real-world scenarios.
